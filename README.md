## Domain of interest
Reason why we are interested in the topic: 
We wanted to implement the data analysis skills we've learned in class and apply it to real world business scenarios. Also, our team is particularly interested in marketing,advertising and finance.

User profiling collect on-site consumer data. They use multiple analytics tools to enable tracking of scattered consumer activity online. For example, companies accumulate customer's interest and actiivites through the search engine. Thus, they predict future purchasing behaviors and preferences. 

Data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain: We want to figure out how the companies accessed data from the user's search engine and how they predict future behaviors.


### Example 2: Social media influence on digital marketing

This dataset is from a social media survey from 'Whatsgooly'. 1500,000 people from different age groups answer questions about which platforms influence their online shopping habits. From this data, we want to investigate the overall effectiveness of digital marketing, which age groups it has the most influence on, which platforms do the best job of advertising and what makes their platform a better for digital marketing. These questions can be answered by looking into the various platforms used by different age groups and the sale rate of these platforms for products that they advertise.
