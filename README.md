## Domain of interest
Reason why we are interested in the topic: 
We wanted to implement the data analysis skills we've learned in class and apply it to real world business scenarios. Also, our team is particularly interested in marketing,advertising and finance. 

Example 1: User profiling

User profiling collect on-site consumer data. They use multiple analytics tools to enable tracking of scattered consumer activity online. For example, companies accumulate customer's interest and actiivites through the search engine. Thus, they predict future purchasing behaviors and preferences. 

Data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain: We want to figure out how the companies accessed data from the user's search engine and how they predict future behaviors.
